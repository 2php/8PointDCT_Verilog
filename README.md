# 8PointDCT_Verilog
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is one of the important image compression algorithms used in image processing applications. Several algorithms have been proposed over the last couple of decades to reduce the number of computations and memory requirements involved in the DCT computation algorithm. One of the algorithms is implemented on Spartan-3E FPGA kit.
